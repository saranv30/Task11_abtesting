# Task 11: A/B Testing – Hypothesis Testing in Python

##  Overview
This project performs A/B Testing using statistical hypothesis testing techniques.
The goal is to compare Control and Test groups and make a data-driven business decision.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib

- Contains user group information (control/test) and conversion data

---

##  Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Separated Control and Test groups
3. Defined Null and Alternative Hypotheses
4. Calculated conversion rates
5. Performed Chi-Square hypothesis test
6. Interpreted p-value and statistical significance
7. Calculated confidence interval
8. Visualized group comparison
9. Made final business recommendation
